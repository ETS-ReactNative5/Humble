//The sample below stores the text 'bar' using the key 'foo' for 3600 seconds, or 1 hour.

    Humble::cache('foo','bar',3600);

//We do the same, but by not passing an expiration, the value will never expire

    Humble::cache('foo','bar');

//By passing just the key, we get back the stored value of 'bar'

    $val = Humble::cache('foo');

//To delete the key, pass in a null for the value argument

    Humble::cache('foo',null);          //The 'foo' key will be deleted
